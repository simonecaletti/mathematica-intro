# Crash course on Mathematica for Graduate Students

This is a (brief) course on Mathematica for physics students I did at Universit√† di Genova in 2021 and 2022. The course is structured as three frontal lessons of 2h each one plus some exercises.

### Program

1. LESSON 1 - First steps in Mathematica and an introducion to some Math Analysis tools:
  - Solve equations and study of a function.
  - Varies free parameters using Manipulate and Table+Plot. 
  - Series expansions, Integrate and Limit in physical simple problems. 
  - Fourier Series.
2. LESSON 2 - Simple implementation of some algebraic calculations:
  - Definition of List and Matrices. Matrix product.
  - Solve linear set of equations with LinearSolve.
  - A simple framework for Special Relativity.
  - Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues. Inertia Tensor for non-trivial objects.
  - Eigenmodes of the multidim. differential equations.The Heat equation.
3. LESSON 3 - Extras
  - Random numbers and a simple MC algorithm.
  - Databases and Packages in Mathematica. Our first Mathematica Package.
  - Animations using Manipulate
  - External Evaluators: Python. The Mathlink tool. Mathematica scripts.
